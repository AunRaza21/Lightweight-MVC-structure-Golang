# Lightweight-MVC-structure-Golang

I have implemented a MVC structure which you use to develop Golang applications. Basic structure is here, you can always extend it. 
Hope it will minimize your time for manual creation of MVC structure in application. 

### How to RUN

1) Install Go

2) export PATH=$PATH:YOUR PATH
 (Set GO path to run)

3) export GOPATH=YOUR_PATH
 (set project path)

4) Type command `go run test_api.go`
